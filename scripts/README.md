# VEIL API Scripts

Utility scripts for managing the VEIL Protocol API.

## Available Scripts

### initMissions.js

Initializes the mission database with sample missions.

**What it does:**
- Creates a SYSTEM_ADMIN user if it doesn't exist
- Creates one mission of each type:
  - **SNS Mission**: Follow @VeilProtocol on X/Twitter
  - **ONCHAIN Mission**: Stake 100 VEIL tokens on BSC
  - **QUIZ Mission**: VEIL Protocol knowledge test with 4 questions

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run directly with node
node scripts/initMissions.js

# Or use npm script (recommended)
npm run init:missions
```

**Environment Requirements:**
- `MONGODB_URI` must be set in `.env` file
- MongoDB server must be running and accessible

**Notes:**
- All missions are set to `ACTIVE` status by default
- Missions expire 30 days after creation
- Safe to run multiple times - creates new missions each time
- If you want to clear existing missions first, use MongoDB Compass or CLI

**Example Output:**
```
âœ… MongoDB Connected
âœ… Found existing SYSTEM_ADMIN user
